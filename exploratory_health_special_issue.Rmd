Now get BMI

```

## Health measures include:
 - Percent Body Fat (`bf_1`)
 - BMI (`bmi_0`)
 
## Behavioral outcome measures

We also have behavioral outcome measures:

 - Food Frequency Questionnaire. Very closely related to the Food Craving Inventory so that needs to be considered carefully.
 


## Self-report predictor variables to investigate 

Which predictor scales should we include?
 
Need the behavioral and self-report imho
 
Before we decide which to include, perhaps we put them into categories: obvious theoretical link to outcome (3), possible theoretical link to outcome (2), no clear theoretical link to outcome (1).
 
Listing them by these categories we get:

### Obvious theoretical link to outcome

These are explicitly designed to measure constructs we are concerned about, like self control or habits.

 - Brief Self Control Scale
 - Self-reported Habit Index
 - Tempest Self-Regulation Questionnaire for Eating
 - Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire
 - Barratt Impulsiveness Scale
 - Eating Dysregulation Measure
 - Food Craving Inventory
 - Restraint Scale


### Possible theoretical link to outcome

These aren't explicitly designed to measure constructs we are concerned about, but there are theoretical reasons or at least 'stories you could tell' to expect a link to outcome.

 - Big Five
 - Planfulness
 - Regulatory Mode Questionnaire
 - Responses to Failure Scale
 - Perceived Competence Scale
 
 

### No clear theoretical link to outcome

For this category it is unclear why we would expect any link to the outcome (eating). Some are included in DEV more because of their theoretical link to the treatment rather than to baseline level of obesity.

 - Need for Cognition Scale
 - Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire
 - Intrinsic Motivation Inventory
 - Adverse Childhood Experiences

### In DEV but not a construct of interest

These are in DEV but aren't psychological constructs and so I'm not considering them.

  - International Physical Activity Questionnaire
  - Demographic measures
  
## Behavioral predictor variables

 - WTP
    - price given for healthy foods
    - price given for unhealthy foods
    - difference between the above two
 - ROC
    - [regulate - look] craving reduction for healthy foods
    - [regulate - look] craving reduction for unhealthy foods
    - balance of the above two
 - SST
    - Participant behavioral net response bias toward healthy foods
    - Participant behavioral net response bias toward unhealthy foods
    - difference between the above
  

# Checking for presence of each of these  

Do we have these scales? let's take a look.

})
data_by_ppt <- purrr::reduce(col_list, left_join,by="SID")



```

Now we do some contrasts we haven't done yet...

```{r}
data_by_ppt$SRHI_healthy_minus_unhealthy <- data_by_ppt$SRHI_healthy-data_by_ppt$SRHI_unhealthy
```

Now we need to get the non-scale social values in here.

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- ppt_data_wide_dummy <- ppt_data_wide -->

<!-- for (cn in colnames(ppt_data_wide_dummy)[3:length(colnames(ppt_data_wide_dummy))]){ -->
<!--   print(cn) -->
<!--   ppt_data_wide_dummy[,cn]<-sample(ppt_data_wide_dummy[,cn],length(ppt_data_wide_dummy[,cn])) -->
<!-- } -->
<!-- rm(ppt_data_wide) -->
<!-- ``` -->

### Exploratory analysis for health special issue

Here we'll follow a few basic steps:

 - Loop through each source and do these analyses. This might occur several times because we'll need to arrange different sources in unique ways.
 - Add each test of interest to a grand table of findings, storing the label, effect, and the p-value
 - Do FWE test on the findings to determine the end result


For each set, we'll need to loop through the three outcome measures, and then loop through the relevant predictor variables. We do two-way correlations to understand which should be followed up.



label the variables
```{r}
IVs <- c("cancer_promoting_minus_preventing_craved_FCI","cancer_promoting_minus_preventing_liked_FCI",
         "EDM","BSCS","ACES_sum",
         "SRHI_sum","SRHI_healthy_minus_unhealthy","TESQ_E","TRSQ","RS","RTFS_factor_1","RTFS_factor_2","BIS_11",
         "ses_aggregate","DEMO_mcarthur_social_standing","cSES"
         
         #'BFI_agreeableness', 'BFI_conscientiousness', 'BFI_extraversion', 'BFI_neuroticism', 'BFI_openness', 
         #'PLAN_cognitive_strategies', 'PLAN_mental_forecasting', 'PLAN_temporal_orientation'
         )
DVs <- c("cancer_promoting_minus_preventing_FFQ","bf_1")
```


Can we merge across surveys to only include the first survey taken? For each of these scales, participants may have only done a selection of the surveys

This would look like:

 - For each participant and column, merge across surveys and only include the FIRST result in each survey.
 

```{r}


#now we estimate R^2....
correlation_df <- data.frame()
for (DV in DVs){
  for(IV in IVs){
    #for (dn in draw_names){
      #pairwise_not_na <- (is.na(data_by_ppt %>% filter(survey_name==dn) %>% .[,IV])==FALSE) &  (is.na(data_by_ppt %>% filter(survey_name==dn) %>% .[,DV])==FALSE)
    pairwise_not_na <- (is.na(data_by_ppt %>% .[,IV])==FALSE) &  (is.na(data_by_ppt %>% .[,DV])==FALSE)
    if(sum(pairwise_not_na)>0){
      print(paste0(DV,",", IV, " (",as.character(sum(pairwise_not_na)) , " values)"))
        cor_res <-cor.test(
          #data_by_ppt %>% filter(survey_name==dn) %>% .[,IV],
          #data_by_ppt %>% filter(survey_name==dn) %>% .[,DV],
          data_by_ppt[[IV]],
          data_by_ppt[[DV]],
          use = "complete.obs"
        )
        #print(paste0("r value of ", as.character(cor_res$estimate)))
        cat(".")
        cor_df <- data.frame(
          "v1"=DV,
          "v2"=IV,
          "n"=sum(pairwise_not_na),
#          "survey"=dn,
          "statistic" = cor_res$statistic,
          "df" = cor_res$parameter,
          "p.value" = cor_res$p.value,
          "estimate"=cor_res$estimate,
          "ci_lower" = cor_res$conf.int[[1]],
          "ci_upper" = cor_res$conf.int[[2]]
          
          
        )
        correlation_df <-rbind(correlation_df,cor_df)
          #correlation_list <- correlation_list %>% add_stats(cor_res)
          

     # }#else{
        #print(paste("no valid column pair for:",IV,",", DV, " (",dn,")"))
      #}
   }
  }
}

#correlation_df <-  tidy_stats_to_data_frame(correlation_list)



```




```{r}
data_by_ppt %>% group_by(DEMO_mcarthur_social_standing) %>% summarise(mean_ffq=mean(cancer_promoting_minus_preventing_FFQ,na.rm=TRUE))

cor.test(data_by_ppt$DEMO_mcarthur_social_standing,data_by_ppt$cancer_promoting_minus_preventing_liked_FCI)
cor.test(data_by_ppt$DEMO_mcarthur_social_standing,data_by_ppt$cancer_promoting_minus_preventing_craved_FCI)
cor.test(data_by_ppt$DEMO_mcarthur_social_standing,data_by_ppt$cancer_promoting_minus_preventing_FFQ)
```


```{r}
ggplot(data_by_ppt,aes(DEMO_mcarthur_social_standing,data_by_ppt$cancer_promoting_minus_preventing_FFQ))+geom_point()
```

## Result

```{r}
View(correlation_df)
```


Now, let's split these up into their families of predictions based on https://osf.io/gvus3:


```{r}
mcc <- function(cor_df){
  cor_df$p.value_adjusted <- p.adjust(cor_df$p.value,method="fdr")
  return(cor_df)
}
```

## Pre-registered predictions

### 1. Food valuation

### 2. Craving

```{r}
craving_ivs <- c("cancer_promoting_minus_preventing_craved_FCI")
craving_cors <- mcc(correlation_df[correlation_df$v2 %in% craving_ivs,])

craving_cors[c("v1","v2","n","p.value","p.value_adjusted")]
```

the Food Craving Inventory is rleated to the Food Frequency Questionnaire but not body fat percentage.

### 3. Habit

```{r}

habit_ivs <- c("SRHI_sum","SRHI_healthy_minus_unhealthy")
habit_cors <- mcc(correlation_df[correlation_df$v2 %in% habit_ivs,])

habit_cors[c("v1","v2","n","p.value","p.value_adjusted")]
```
The Self Report Habit Index is related to the Food Frequency Questionnaire but not body fat percentage.

overall habit score is not related to health outcomes.

```{r}
summary(lm(cancer_promoting_minus_preventing_FFQ~SRHI_healthy+SRHI_unhealthy,data_by_ppt))

summary(lm(cancer_promoting_FFQ~SRHI_healthy+SRHI_unhealthy,data_by_ppt))

summary(lm(cancer_preventing_FFQ~SRHI_healthy+SRHI_unhealthy,data_by_ppt))

cor(data_by_ppt[,c("cancer_promoting_FFQ","cancer_preventing_FFQ","SRHI_healthy","SRHI_unhealthy")],use = "pairwise.complete.obs")


cor(data_by_ppt[,c("cancer_promoting_FFQ","cancer_preventing_FFQ","SRHI_healthy","SRHI_unhealthy", "bf_1")],use = "pairwise.complete.obs")


cor.test(data_by_ppt$SRHI_unhealthy,data_by_ppt$bf_1,use = "pairwise.complete.obs")
cor.test(data_by_ppt$cancer_promoting_FFQ,data_by_ppt$bf_1,use = "pairwise.complete.obs")
cor.test(data_by_ppt$cancer_preventing_FFQ,data_by_ppt$bf_1,use = "pairwise.complete.obs")
#OK nahhhh

cor.test(data_by_ppt$cancer_promoting_FFQ,data_by_ppt$SRHI_healthy,use = "pairwise.complete.obs")
cor.test(data_by_ppt$cancer_promoting_FFQ,data_by_ppt$SRHI_unhealthy,use = "pairwise.complete.obs")
cor.test(data_by_ppt$cancer_preventing_FFQ,data_by_ppt$SRHI_healthy,use = "pairwise.complete.obs")
cor.test(data_by_ppt$cancer_preventing_FFQ,data_by_ppt$SRHI_unhealthy,use = "pairwise.complete.obs")
```



```{r}

```

### 4. Inhibitory control and self regulation

```{r}
inhibitory_ivs <- c("TESQ_E","TRSQ",
         "BIS_11","BSCS",
         "EDM","RS")
inhibitory_cors <- mcc(correlation_df[correlation_df$v2 %in% inhibitory_ivs,])

inhibitory_cors[c("v1","v2","n","p.value","p.value_adjusted")]

cor.test(data_by_ppt$cancer_promoting_FFQ,data_by_ppt$TESQ_E,use = "pairwise.complete.obs")
cor.test(data_by_ppt$cancer_preventing_FFQ,data_by_ppt$TESQ_E,use = "pairwise.complete.obs")


 
```

The Tempest Self-Regulation Questionnaire for Eating is related to the Food Frequency Questionnaire. 

No other inhibitory control measure relates to the Food Frequency Questionnaire before or after controlling for multiple comparisons. While we still need to add planned behavioral measures I do not expect this will affect the adjusted significance of any of the existing findings. The TESQ_E is strongly related to FFQ in a way that will survive a lot more multiple comparisons than this.

It would be useful to examine the breakdown of the TESQ_E subscales and their relationship to the food frequency questionnaire.

There are some items that were significant when not adjusted for the multiple comparison, but not significant after adjusting:

 - BIS_11 * FFQ
 - Body Fat % * RS
 
 
It might be worth using these findings to guide neural investigation even as we acknowledge the evidence is not strong for them as main effects.

### 5. Socioeconomic

```{r}
ses_ivs <- c("ACES_sum","ses_aggregate","DEMO_mcarthur_social_standing","cSES")
ses_cors <- mcc(correlation_df[correlation_df$v2 %in% ses_ivs,])

ses_cors[c("v1","v2","n","p.value","p.value_adjusted","estimate")]
```
There is one relationship that is significant before but not after adjusting for multiple comparisons FFQ * the mcarthur ladder appears significant (p=0.02); however the estimate is in the reverse direction of that anticipated. 

## Effects definitely worth a closer look

Craving: Food Craving Inventory is related to the Food Frequency Questionnaire

Habits: The Self-report habit index (healthy minus unhealthy contrast) is strongly related to the Food Frequency Questionnaire, although not to the BF%.

Inhibitory control: The Tempest Self-Regulation Questionnaire for Eating is related to the Food Frequency Questionnaire. 

For each of these we can look at neural mediators. If we wanted to, we could tie this up into a single pretty powerful paper that demonstrates a trifecta of craving, habits, and inhibitory control all contributing to eating.

No relationships were found between socioeconomic measures and health outcomes.

### Investigating possible relationships with the values we found.

All of the variables that correlated with FFQ are very specifically food-related. Only explicitly-food-related versions of these constructs relate to FFQ, and none really relate to BF%.

I wonder how much _they_ correlate with the more generic measures of their constructs? For instance, how does TESQ-E relate to other measures of inhibitory control?

```{r}
cor.test(data_by_ppt$TESQ_E,data_by_ppt$cancer_promoting_minus_preventing_FFQ)
cor.test(data_by_ppt$TESQ_E,data_by_ppt$BIS_11)
cor.test(data_by_ppt$TESQ_E,data_by_ppt$BSCS)
cor.test(data_by_ppt$TESQ_E,data_by_ppt$BFI_conscientiousness)
cor.test(data_by_ppt$TESQ_E,data_by_ppt$BFI_conscientiousness)
```

hmm--nothing very strong!

No other habit measures to look at but what about craving?


```{r}
cor.test(data_by_ppt$cancer_promoting_minus_preventing_craved_FCI,data_by_ppt$BIS_11)
```

## broad look at correlation plot


```{r}
vars_of_interest <- c("TESQ_E","cancer_promoting_minus_preventing_craved_FCI","SRHI_healthy_minus_unhealthy","cancer_promoting_minus_preventing_FFQ")

cor(data_by_ppt[,vars_of_interest],use = "pairwise.complete.obs")
```

So these three measures are just very strongly correlated generally; likely capturing the same underlying thing?


```{r}
print(summary(lm(cancer_promoting_minus_preventing_FFQ~TESQ_E+cancer_promoting_minus_preventing_craved_FCI+SRHI_healthy_minus_unhealthy,data_by_ppt)))
print(summary(lm(cancer_promoting_minus_preventing_FFQ~TESQ_E,data_by_ppt)))
print(summary(lm(cancer_promoting_minus_preventing_FFQ~cancer_promoting_minus_preventing_craved_FCI,data_by_ppt)))
print(summary(lm(cancer_promoting_minus_preventing_FFQ~SRHI_healthy_minus_unhealthy,data_by_ppt)))

null_rows <- apply(is.na(data_by_ppt[,vars_of_interest]),1,any)
print(anova(
  lm(cancer_promoting_minus_preventing_FFQ~cancer_promoting_minus_preventing_craved_FCI,data_by_ppt[null_rows==FALSE,]),
lm(cancer_promoting_minus_preventing_FFQ~TESQ_E+cancer_promoting_minus_preventing_craved_FCI+SRHI_healthy_minus_unhealthy,data_by_ppt[null_rows==FALSE,])
))

print(anova(
  lm(cancer_promoting_minus_preventing_FFQ~cancer_promoting_minus_preventing_craved_FCI+SRHI_healthy_minus_unhealthy,data_by_ppt[null_rows==FALSE,]),
lm(cancer_promoting_minus_preventing_FFQ~TESQ_E+cancer_promoting_minus_preventing_craved_FCI+SRHI_healthy_minus_unhealthy,data_by_ppt[null_rows==FALSE,])
))

So...FCI alone predicts 31% of variance of FFQ; all three combined predicts 35% of variance; including TESQ_E in the model does NOT improve model fit, though the SRHI does.

So: SHRI has some extra predictive power.

We might also extend this with an ML approach: apply a learning approach to classify subjects into groups. Can't expect this to give us too much because there'll only be ~150 subjects or so in the model.



let's leave this until we have the behavioral data but I will get to it!


## Supplementary analysis

Of the above I have already examined one outcome, Responses to Failure Scale. This appears to be a fairly robust finding:


```{r}
rtfs_ivs <- c("RTFS_factor_1","RTFS_factor_2")
rtfs_cors <- mcc(correlation_df[correlation_df$v2 %in% rtfs_ivs,])

rtfs_cors[c("v1","v2","n","p.value","p.value_adjusted","estimate")]
```
It isn't clear that it fits into any of the above categories.

There are additional items we might examine:

 - Big Five
 - Planfulness
 - Regulatory Mode Questionnaire
 - Perceived Competence Scale
 - Mother and/or father education
 - All the individual levels of income that we only tested in aggregate for this analysis ((a) zipcode typical income, (b) total household income, (c) household per capita income, (d) education level)

Seems cheeky to go and do a _second_ pre-registration for these so I recommend just going ahead with a further analysis; however I want to seek input from others first.

Also, what about considering more granular measures in the FFQ and FCI?
