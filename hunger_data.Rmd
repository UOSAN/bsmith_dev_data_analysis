This is a notebook designed for understanding the data about hunger available in DEV.

First let's take a look at the hunger data from redcap session 1 (the day of the first scan).

```{r}


Sys.setenv(R_CONFIG_ACTIVE = Sys.info()["nodename"])
data_dir <- config::get("dev_analysis_data_dir")


```

```{r}

setwd(paste0(data_dir,"hunger/"))

source("DEV-Session1Data_R_2022-04-19_2347.r")
```

```{r}

hist(data$hunger_1)
```

This looks like a reasonable distribution of data. So--are there useful things we can do with this to work on a multi-objective analysis of food craving? Let's:

-   Go back and examine our objectives a little bit. What's "multi-objective" about this? Maybe read through notes from discussion with Steve.

-   Look at whether it correlates with craving ratings at all. Consider pre-registering a plan before you go ahead with this.
